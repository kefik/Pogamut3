; This is modified from clean-dog.lap to make the dogs act more like sheep -- they flock with the sheep (but at a greater distance)
; and with each other, so they spend less time on top of each other.  To make this really look smart though a) the sheep need to move away
; from the dogs more, and the dogs need to pick up strays
